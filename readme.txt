This is the project exercise code from a Udemy "NodeJS - The Complete Guide" course.

This initial code check in starts at Lesson #229 just prior to working with Sessions and
Cookies, right after hooking up the MongoDB database and integrating it with Mongoose.

As usual with anything related to Node JS, the "node_modules" folder was excluded so the 
need to run "npm install" will have to be done if/when this repository is copied to a 
different machine and/or folder than the original master instance.

Deviations from course's original code:

1) A number of minor tweaks were made to the code such as re-ordering some of the 
   functions in the Shop and Admin controllers, minor tweaks to some of the console
   log statements.

What's coming next?

1) I would like to revisit the UI views screens (likely at the end of the course) as 
   while the styling isn't too bad, the layout of all the screens are pretty basic 
   and could definitely be improved.
